            "The methodology presented in the paper introduces a novel framework called MIMO for controllable character video synthesis. The core idea is to decompose a 2D video into spatial components considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Here's a summarized breakdown of the methodology:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Spatial Decomposition**: The video is split into three main components: the main human subject, the underlying scene, and floating occlusions (foreground objects). This is achieved by lifting 2D pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators and then decomposing the video clip into hierarchical layers based on 3D depth.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Encoding Spatial Components**:\n",
            "   - **Human Component**: This is further disentangled into identity and motion codes. The identity is captured using a canonical appearance transfer, while the motion is encoded via structured body codes anchored to a deformable human body model (SMPL).\n",
            "   - **Scene and Occlusion Components**: These are embedded using a shared VAE encoder and reorganized into a full scene code.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Composed Decoding**: The latent codes of the decomposed attributes are recomposed as conditions for a diffusion-based decoder to reconstruct the video. The decoder uses a denoising U-Net backbone with temporal layers, where the full scene code, motion code, and identity code are inserted as conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Training**: The model is trained using a diffusion noise-prediction loss, with the denoising U-Net, pose encoder, and reference-net being optimized. The training dataset includes real and synthetic character videos, with the synthetic videos providing accurate annotations.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Controllable Synthesis**: The method allows for flexible user control, where attributes like character, motion, and scene can be provided via simple inputs (e.g., a single image for character, a pose sequence for motion, and a single video/image for scene) or extracted from in-the-wild videos.\n",
            "\n",
