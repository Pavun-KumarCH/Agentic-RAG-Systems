These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be categorized into several types, each with different capabilities and applications:\\n\\n1. **Narrow or Weak AI**: Designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car).\\n\\n2. **General or Strong AI**: Hypothetical AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across various tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities. This type of AI does not yet exist.\\n\\n3. **Superintelligent AI**: A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in every economically valuable work. This is still a conceptual idea and not a reality.\\n\\n### Key Components of AI\\n\\n1. **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\\n\\n2. **Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.\\n\\n3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The ability of a computer to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\\n\\n4. **Computer Vision**: The ability of a computer to interpret and make decisions based on visual input from the world.\\n\\n5. **Robotics**: The design and use of robots to perform tasks that are typically done by humans.\\n\\n### Applications of AI\\n\\n1. **Healthcare**: Diagnosing diseases, developing new drugs, and personalizing treatment plans.\\n2. **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk management.\\n3. **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles, traffic management, and route optimization.\\n4. **Customer Service**: Chatbots, virtual assistants, and personalized recommendations.\\n5. **Entertainment**: Game development, content creation, and personalized media experiences.\\n6. **Manufacturing**: Predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization.\\n\\n### Ethical Considerations\\n\\n1. **Bias and Fairness**: Ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate or amplify existing biases.\\n2. **Privacy'"

The core idea is to decompose a 2D video into spatial components considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Here's a summarized breakdown of the methodology:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Spatial Decomposition**: The video is split into three main components: the main human subject, the underlying scene, and floating occlusions (foreground objects). This is achieved by lifting 2D pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators and then decomposing the video clip into hierarchical layers based on 3D depth.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Encoding Spatial Components**:\n",
            "   - **Human Component**: This is further disentangled into identity and motion codes. The identity is captured using a canonical appearance transfer, while the motion is encoded via structured body codes anchored to a deformable human body model (SMPL).\n",
            "   - **Scene and Occlusion Components**: These are embedded using a shared VAE encoder and reorganized into a full scene code.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Composed Decoding**: The latent codes of the decomposed attributes are recomposed as conditions for a diffusion-based decoder to reconstruct the video. The decoder uses a denoising U-Net backbone with temporal layers, where the full scene code, motion code, and identity code are inserted as conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Training**: The model is trained using a diffusion noise-prediction loss, with the denoising U-Net, pose encoder, and reference-net being optimized. The training dataset includes real and synthetic character videos, with the synthetic videos providing accurate annotations.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Controllable Synthesis**: The method allows for flexible user control, where attributes like character, motion, and scene can be provided via simple inputs (e.g., a single image for character, a pose sequence for motion, and a single video/image for scene) or extracted from in-the-wild videos.\n",
            "\n",
